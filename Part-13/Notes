What is ActionChains in Selenium?
----------------------------------
ActionChains is a special Selenium class used to perform advanced user interactions that cannot be done with normal click() or send_keys() methods.

These interactions simulate real mouse and keyboard actions.

Why do we use ActionChains?
-----------------------------
Because some actions require complex movement or multiple steps, such as:

Hovering the mouse over an element (to show a tooltip)

Drag and drop

Double-click

Right-click (context click)

Holding keyboard keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt)

Click and hold, then release

Performing multiple steps in sequence

Normal Selenium commands cannot handle these easily, so ActionChains is used.

How to use ActionChains
--------------------------
1. Create an ActionChains object
actions = ActionChains(driver)


driver represents the browser.

This tells ActionChains which browser window it should perform the actions on.

What can ActionChains do?
--------------------------
ActionChains can:

Move the mouse to an element

Press or release mouse buttons

Press or release keyboard keys

Combine many actions together in a chain

Run all actions together in a sequence using .perform()

Example:

actions.move_to_element(element).click().perform()


This will move the mouse to the element and then click it.
